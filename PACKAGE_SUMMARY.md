## 💡 Common Questions & Answers

### "Is this connected to real banks?"
**Answer**: "Not yet - this is a frontend demo showing the UI and concept. Banking integration is Phase 2, requiring formal partnerships with SA banks and IEC approval."

### "What about security?"
**Answer**: "Production version will use:
- Bank-grade AES-256 encryption
- OAuth 2.0 + Multi-Factor Authentication
- ISO/IEC 27001 compliance
- Annual penetration testing
- Immutable audit trails"

### "Can existing parties keep their systems?"
**Answer**: "Yes! We provide REST APIs so parties can integrate this with their existing finance software. Think of it as an overlay, not a replacement."

### "How much will this cost?"
**Answer**: "We project R15M for Year 1 development (MVP). ROI is positive by Month 18. Parties pay annual licenses (±R50k), government provides infrastructure support. See financial projections in EXECUTIVE_PRESENTATION.md."

### "When can we launch?"
**Answer**: "12-month development cycle:
- Months 1-4: Backend MVP
- Months 5-6: Banking integration
- Months 7-9: Crypto module
- Months 10-12: Testing & launch
Target: Q1 2027 national rollout"

### "What about POPIA compliance?"
**Answer**: "Designed for POPIA from day one:
- Minimal data collection
- Explicit consent mechanisms
- Data retention policies
- User access rights
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular audits"

## 🔥 Emergency Backup Plans

### If Demo Breaks During Presentation

**Option 1**: Switch to single-file demo
```bash
Open: political-funding-demo.html
(Keep this open in a background tab just in case)
```

**Option 2**: Use screenshots
```bash
Take screenshots of key screens beforehand
Put in PowerPoint as backup
```

**Option 3**: Show architecture diagrams
```bash
Present from TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md
Focus on vision, not demo
```

**Option 4**: Video recording
```bash
Record demo beforehand
Play video if live demo fails
```

## 🎓 Understanding the Architecture

### Why Modular Structure?

**Before (Single File)**: Everything in one HTML file
- ❌ Hard to maintain
- ❌ Difficult to extend
- ❌ No reusability
- ❌ Not production-ready

**After (Modular)**: Proper separation of concerns
- ✅ Easy to maintain
- ✅ Simple to extend
- ✅ Reusable components
- ✅ Production-ready architecture

### Migration to Production

**Step 1**: Replace MockDataService
```javascript
// FROM: Mock data
class MockDataService {
    async getTransactions() {
        return [/* hardcoded */];
    }
}

// TO: Real API
class APIService {
    async getTransactions() {
        return await fetch('/api/v1/transactions');
    }
}
```

**Step 2**: Add authentication
```javascript
// Add to App.jsx
const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(false);
```

**Step 3**: Connect to backend
```javascript
// Update constants.js
const CONFIG = {
    API_ENDPOINTS: {
        BASE_URL: 'https://api.soldierholdings.co.za'
    }
};
```

**That's it!** Components don't change - only the service layer.
